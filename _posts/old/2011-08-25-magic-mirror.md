LATELY I am trying new adventures. From past experience I noticed that for my every quest I got always capricious reactions. The comments which I usually get lie between approbative and mild criticism, even sometime sarcastic taunts. But thanks to my endurance, I decided to go for new hunt. While thinking about next move, accidently I came across mirror. I always wanted a furtive glance in Snow White Mirror. Alas! No chance in this Muggle Blood. I stared at my unclear image. That dusty glass was unable to reflect my true personality [ 😛 ]. I looked at my 2 month old beard and mustache. I imagined one Dwarf with black beard [Again Snow White Fantasy … 😀 ]. When I gazed at my belly , puzzled and wondered ! That voluminous trunk was not sign of gourmandism. Believe me, it’s ‘Home Food Effect,’ nothing else; considering my last 4 years on mess food. Immediately I checked calendar. It was hardly 2 months. Deliberating these extra 6 kg, “_Every day I was gaining 100 gm._”

 My mind got wordy with some ‘unfortunate’ words like Exercise, Gym, and Swimming. At first I thought these ideas are prosaic. As an Engineer, Matter of fact approach to problem narrowed my option to ‘Jogging’.

 I asked my muggle mirror, “Is it good idea?”

 No answer!

 I asked again, and what a surprise! I heard some muttering. Inaudible, but still I was trying to listen. Though my conscious mind told me that’s Fruit fly who is shacking her wings, I wasn’t ready to buy it. Bah! Finally I woke up from this daydream when that Fruit Fly landed on my nose tip.

It seems still adventurous to me. I was looking at this with Positive attitude. As a result one of my old thoughts came to me with different avatar,

“_Every day I was losing -100 gm._“

Meanwhile I didn’t notice that my Mom was standing behind me. She wasn’t puzzled as she was aware of what can 21 years old boy do in front of mirror. I returned to my room directly towards closet to check Sport Shoe. As soon I opened door, I faced one more Mirror. That mirror was trying to pull me again inside fantasy world but my mind barraged with Jogging thoughts.

“_What you doing there? Come here_“

I heard clear voice this time. I pinched myself and started searching that bastard fruit fly.

*“Rohit, what’s wrong?”*

Now, there was neither fruit fly nor ‘inner’ sound of my conscious mind. I was thrilled. I adjusted that mirror towards light to check what’s going on. How unfortunate am I! There was no Snow White. [:( ] I turned around and saw my mother staring at me, this time with Puzzle!

*“Are you okay dear?”*

Certainly I was not. *“I needed cup of coffee.”* I replied with yawn.

She left room when I landed on my bed. It seemed that paranoia was still chasing me. I saw my reflection on Fan hanging on sealing. This time that mirroring me a bizarre image. Image was 7-8 kg thinner. I started reconsidering my new venture. Again that fruit fly was roaming around my head. I lost my patience and started searching potential weapons. There was newspaper on table. I got what I need but my target was missing. Sadism!

I went to kitchen and get one glass of water. Now my image was fluctuating. As soon as I drank ‘half’ of water, I don’t know it was dilemma or dizziness but that half glass forced me to think … Was that end of my new adventure? No wait! It was never started one. Still starting new venture is an adventure. So why call it adventure? Am I confused or feeling sleepy? And what the hell is “Huummm..hummm” means?

Ohhh! As I expected, my old ‘friend’ followed me inside kitchen. That fruit fly buzzing was blended with my thoughts. I was on verge of reality and fantasy. Mirror was pulling me inside while my mind and ‘friend’ were keeping me on ground.

I was allured by Snow White but Coffee was what I need.

Hell yahh !

Coffee is what you need when you started thinking about half empty glass and half full. 😛
