When all other fixture souls were indulging into their ephemeral dreams about Friday night, I was on verge of organic and inorganic world. Even Apollo was abdicating empire to Luna. Coldness of that roaring wind was augmented due to height of that hill. I tightened my hold on sweater. Body was producing heat through continuous vibrations. I was able to hear only sound of wind, and now bonfire; considering coefficient of friction of my jersey was not satisfactory. That magnificent aura on horizon was rendering into deep, dark void. When those benevolent birds were returning to their loved ones, I was camping in that secluded place. I was not inspired by ‘<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758/" target="_blank">Into the Wild</a>’ neither trapped like ‘<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162222/" target="_blank">Cast Away</a>’. Just roving away from any direction leads to destiny. I was perched on that passive stone with only elements who can listen to my silence as interestingly as kid listening to Cindrella story.

Sometimes it’s amusing that not thinking about thoughts and listening to nature’s own Rap. Crickets were adding salt to that ‘natural’ song. Everyone was happy about weekends but I was indifferent. Some says adventures and challenges are the players who kept your match playing till end. Without them everything is empty. I do believe in him. But sometimes mind pop ups different ideas. Celestial bodies offer reasonable explanation. They are numerous and far beyond our reach. They become visible in clear sky but disappear near vicinity of lunar aura. They are actually so far that we always saw their thousand light year old reflections. Still we are searching selfishly their patterns and tempting figures. Our desires are numerous and far beyond our reach. They become visible in passive, hostile environment but disappear in vicinity of achievements! Reality is always different that we imagined.

I realized that we always make things complicating after listening alarm set on my mobile. We push our self into sea, where we have already planted traps. And when we got entangled into these, we realize we shouldn’t have planted them.

I checked time, it was late. That was time to face towards my path…

After all; I was ‘also’ **Human**.
