_“He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you“_
— Friedrich Nietzsche

That’s what happened when I looked long enough in the Reading Comprehension passages of ETS. Sad <a href="http://www.ets.org/" target="_blank"> ETS </a>! I have no idea from where they gather their passages; it was like reading ancient Mayan language. I could have been more correct about meanings of Mayans but I let my guards down when it comes to those eclectic, crafty write-ups.

Nietzsche and I first met in September 2010 in one of the RC passages, especially about literary renaissance. Technically he was little related to rebirth I mentioned above. Hence I should take this opportunity to thanks Wikipedia. Wiki was/is/will always be the vessel of digression. I must say, every detour I took on Wikipedia reveals new facet. At that time it was better to engulf into literary articles than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000098/" target="_blank">Jenifer Aniston</a>’s affairs. Do not underestimate my words as well as power of Wikipedia. There is no link between Nietzsche and Jennifer but you may end up on both the pages within few minutes.

When I first read Nietzsche’s article from ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra" target="_blank">Thus spoke Zarathustra </a>’, I was impressed. Though I didn’t understand single line from that article (Except one “Friedrich Nietzsche born on 15th October 1844”), there was something mysterious about his article.  Last time I experienced such spark in ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batatyachi_Chal" target="_blank">Batatyachi Chal</a>’ by Pu. L. Deshpande. Certainly, scenario was different but feelings were same. Further, I started reading his book “Beyond Good and Evil”, still reading. This is difficult novel but worth reading. His distinguish thoughts are, no doubt, better food for our thoughts.

I have read many articles about philosophy but his works seems different. Before, I was indifferent to such philosophical writing. I always thought that was ‘High-Class’ S##t.  Definitely, that was something more than normal men’s perceptions and reading between lines.  His nihilist philosophy may looks like atheist and caustic but has point.  Skepticism is important and so are believes. There should be line between these two. As quoted from ‘Prejudices of Philosophers’, “Every great philosophy up till now has consisted of- namely, the confession of its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography”. I agree, in fact, my advance writing is inspired by this conscious philosophy. I find resemblance of such philosophy with music from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart" target="_blank">Mozart</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhimsen_Joshi" target="_blank">Pt. Bhimsen Joshi</a>. Both were legends and pioneer in their area of expertise. When you listen to their music first time, you will not understand depth and hidden meaning. As soon as you will use to their pitch, you will find that music has some own philosophy. I think music and philosophy has parallel roots.

Anybody can become philosopher, ohh wait, they are! Refined and sophisticated version of your thoughts could be the trigger you are looking for. One should be philosopher, at least once in lifetime! You may not be Adept, but will become Adaptive.
