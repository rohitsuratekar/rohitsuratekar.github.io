Aristotle said once, I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who overcomes his enemies. We all are trapped inside our endless desires. Why humans are not ever satisfied? We always want something; food, money, sex, status, friends, social life, sports, trips, peace, war, superpowers!! Our mind is constantly trying to catch something, most of the times some elusive things. Why can’t we live like other living things? Have you ever thought if reproduction and survival are the only goals, why are we worried about so many things? Many researchers are trying to orient answer to this question towards consciousness. But do you think is it really unique to us? EvolutionWe are NOT the only living things which have cognitive abilities.

People were trying to address this question since 17 century [1]. This endeavor has also touched various philosophical topics including the Body-Mind problem. Thomas Nagel’s famous paper “<a href="http://organizations.utep.edu/portals/1475/nagel_bat.pdf" target="_blank">What is like to be a bat</a>” had similar perspectives. Birds are thought to be evolved cognition parallel to humans. There are plenty of reports ranging from abstract concept [2] to symbolic communication [3]. More notably research of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Pepperberg" target="_blank">Irene Pepperberg</a> and her group on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_%28parrot%29" target="_blank">Alex</a> the parrot. Not only birds, there are many different animals including dogs, cats, chimpanzees, few invertebrates on which different cognitive experiments have been done. There is whole separate section on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> about Animal Consciousness. If these animals have some kind of consciousness, why they are not acting like human? Do they have such ever unsatisfied desires? Our current experimental technologies don’t have this answer. But philosophy is dealing with this issue since pre-Aristotle time [4]. Plato suggests that individual desires must be postponed in the name of the higher ideal while Kant categorized them into ‘hypothetical imperative’. These all philosophers defined desire in different ways but at the end purpose of human desire remains elusive rather with unsatisfied answers. This question is worth thinking about. We are not great philosophers but we have enough ‘consciousness’ to think about it. Evolution requires survival and reproduction. Though conscience has been associated with encephalization during course of evolution, where does the desire plays role into this? Is it heritable entity? Where the desire does came from? More importantly why we are always unsatisfied? It looks like more we are thinking about it, more we are getting unsatisfied answers!
