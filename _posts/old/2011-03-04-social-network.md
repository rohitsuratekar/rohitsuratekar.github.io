[Part I] Intro  
*“You don’t get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies”*.  
Lines from Movie Social Network [2010] Directed by David Fincher. Besides ironic part, it is showing reality. Social Network is complex phenomenon than it appears. Just hitting search on google you will get more than 100,000,000 results for term “Social Network”. We can imagine the spread of this term into our community or world. Social Network is associated with many things but we are concentrating now on the Social Network sites like Facebook, Orkut etc. Presently many social Networking sites are active over the internet. Even we can see specialization in them like Academic Networks, Professional Network, Entertainment Network, blah blah blah…
Yesterday, I met my old friend from my First Standard on Facebook! You might have such experience with such sites [Now Don’t say you aren’t joined any social networking site. If you are not, no point in further reading this blog post, seriously!] Right now it is one of the needs in addition to Food, Water, Shelter, and Mobile [at least for Students]. There are several factors responsible for its success. First and most important is Free and Easy to access. These social networking sites are totally free. Anybody can create account and can start ‘Acting Social’. You can access it from anywhere around world from your laptop to your mobile texts. Now recently “Gogo Inflight Internet” is offering facebook service on Flight! So u can be in touch with your friends even in sky. It’s fastest and user friendly.

On other side, we can’t ignore the fact that every coin has two sides. There is ‘Black’ side for social networking. When we are talking about the Black side of Internet, first thing pop up in our mind is ‘Misuse’. Fake profile, Frauds, Spams etc. are not new to social networks. Now a day Government is taking such fraud seriously. They have already implanted cyber-crime laws. Many celebrities were trapped into controversy due to their updates or comments on Social networking sites. Most important drawback which I personally believe is ‘Time Waste’! Students, Employees are wasting their precious time onto such social networking sites. Many Colleges and Companies have banned social networking sites from their campus. But students are wasting more time on unblocking them [: P]. At Last one thing we should remember that we cannot lose our real life over this virtual life.
