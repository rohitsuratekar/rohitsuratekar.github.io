It is definitely not what you are thinking. If the thoughts about Facebook notification touched your mind, go outside and get some ‘real’ life! [It is coming from person like me, strange but true] This was about one email notification. My heart was pounding really fast. That strange mail was staring at me like something important. I was really amazed to check that notification, which I sent one year back! It was started in February 2011 a week after valentine day [ 😉 ].

But before we start, you should know reason behind this affection. I completed my applications for masters in December 2011. So admission decisions of universities will be rolling out from February 2012. Every day I was checking my mail almost every time I visited Facebook. Now you can get idea about how desperate I was! Each time I open my mail account, I saw “4-5 unread mails”. And when I saw their subjects, ‘XYZ group has updated’, ‘XYZ has sent you friend request of some XYZ’, ‘ABC has won million dollar lottery!’ To avoid frustration, I unsubscribed all my subscriptions to all fun groups and sites. I should not say situation improved, But after that whenever I opened my account, it showed me ‘1 unread mail’ or ‘No new notification’. Bahh! That was more frustrating.  In lieu of this, my excitation was in Log Phase. In addition, some of my friends got admit from universities. In result, my mind was creating ripples about ‘these’ mails. There was one more thing, my messenger always produce some strange sound when there is any unread mail. My situation was similar to that <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/pavlov/readmore.html" target="_blank">Ivan Pavlov’s Dog</a>. Whenever I heard that messenger sound, my mouse automatically clicks on Firefox shortcut on my desktop. Then my brain will start producing some unnecessary thoughts. It was reflex, I can’t control it. As a result, every mail I received was treated like a mail from Nobel Nomination committee.

Now back to valentine day of 2011. It was last semester of my Engineering. We all friends were indulged in past four year’s memories. I created one ’To Do’ list, the list of things I never did in these 4 years but want to do before leaving this hostel life…

Well some of them I am writing here [Censored Version 😛 ]

**Eating Maggi in our College’s main Cafeteria ‘Nescafe’.**  
[It is strange but I never went there because it was costing me double than my regular canteen at hostel 😀 and they says ‘single’ people like me are not welcome there  😐 ]

**Playing Volleyball at main ground in middle of night**  
[I am not a sport person. But there were rumors that some hot MCA chicks play Volleyball on weekends on main ground. This was not logical because Girls Hotel will not allow girls after 9 pm. But someone put Picture of girls playing at night on Facebook and we got convinced.]

**Continuous Gym for whole week**  
[Indeed, This was most difficult task in my entire list. Not just this list. I was planning this ‘adventure’ since last 3 years  😐 ]

**Watch Sunrise at Naini Bridge**  
[This was one of the famous spot for hanging out in city. I had no intention of completing this task but legend was my engineering will never complete without this event. At least what I heard from my seniors]

**Prank ChiChi (our Night Canteen Owner) for free Cold Drinks**  
[Chichi was one hell of a narrow minded person. Her canteen was costing 5-10 more bucks than normal value on every item. So this was one of the common dreams among students to get Free Drink from her. It sounds easy but her accounting skills were good. Hence it was challenging task.]

**Collect all the lend money from friends**  
[It is fact that, Friend in need is friend indeed. But in some of the cases like this one, I would suggest ‘Bite Me’! And still you are believer of that quote; I would suggest borrowing some from others. Then it would be fair. ]

**Date with a college Girl**  
[Now, this was something out of my expertise but it was effect of Valentine Day! Challenge Accepted!! ]

And there were some more like these. Now on one crispy afternoon, me and my friend were having lunch in cafeteria. We were discussing about my ‘to-do’ list. Discussion was pretty loud. 4-5 other students joined us. At the end of discussion, we end up on one ‘bet’.

“_I have to complete at least 3 of these things; else I will give treat to all the friends in one of the costly hotels and vice versa_”

That list may sound easy to you but practically difficult for me. I came to compromise with friend that I will complete at least 3 of these in 1 year.  And that moment we set a reminder on http://emailfuture.com/ , which will automatically send us email in future!!

> To  
> future Rohit,  
>I am sending this mail on 21 February 2011. I hope this mail server will deliver you on 21 February 2012. And if you receive this mail, I guess world is not ended yet! 😛   
>This is reminder that you have to complete at least 3 things from your “to do “list made this week. If you are unable to complete your objective, it is mandatory that you have to teat XYZ (friend’s name) in the most costly hotel in present city.  
>Digital Signature  
>Rohit  
>XYZ  
>Referee: ABC [another third party friend who will decide who won and who lost]

Well, I was totally forgotten about this bet and my to-do list. I was expecting some serious email from my admission applications. Instead I got this wonderful mail. I was laughing at home for almost half an hour when I received this mail this February. The emotions at that time were priceless! There was laugh, nostalgia, happiness, satisfaction and also fear. Blending mixture of these was ecstatic. My mother came to my room to check what is going on. I was smiling at my laptop screen with mobile in one hand. Many memories refreshed. I immediately called that friend and told him,

**“You owe me one dinner at Costly hotel in your city!”**
